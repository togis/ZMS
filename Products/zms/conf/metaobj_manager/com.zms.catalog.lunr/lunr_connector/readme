# SimpleSearch powered by Lunr

This is a demo how to easily display [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) index using javascript and generic styling using [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/). It is inspired by [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and utilizes [ZMS REST API](swagger_ui) to fetch the content nodes. Intended use cases are self-contained (micro)sites, where complex search backend services are overkill.

It expects documents to be composed of fields `title` and `text`.

To search just Build a `search_index.json` powered by [Lunr.py](https://lunr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and go to the [search interface](lunr_page).
